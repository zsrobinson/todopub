## TodoPub: Todoist Public Projects

A simple tool to create public links to view Todoist projects. The user first generates a token containing their Todoist API and Project ID, and then can share a link containing that token to others. Tokens are encrypted using a secret stored on the server, but no data is persisted on the server.
